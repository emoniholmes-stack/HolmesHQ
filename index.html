    <!-- ETHICS 3 -->
    <section id="ethics3">
      <h2>Ethics Check #3</h2>
      <p>In business, I often work with private information. For example, when I handle financial records, customer accounts, or billing statements, I might see names, payment details, or other sensitive info. It’s important to handle that carefully so people can trust me to protect their information. Being responsible with private details helps build integrity and shows respect for others.</p>

    <!-- ETHICS 4 -->
    <section id="ethics4">
      <h2>Ethics Check #4 — Attribution and Ownership (Week 4)</h2>
      <p>For my site, I plan to respect ownership by only using content I have created myself or content that is clearly allowed for reuse. If I use images or text from other creators, I will make sure they are properly licensed and give credit where it's due. One Creative Commons license I might use is the CC BY-SA license because it allows remixing and sharing as long as attribution is given and new creations use the same license. A biblical principle that ties into this is honoring others' work, which reflects honesty and integrity (Proverbs 12:22).</p>

    <!-- DEVOTIONAL -->
    <section id="devotional">
      <h2>Serving with a Pure Heart</h2>
      <p><strong>“Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people.” — Ephesians 6:7 (NIV)</strong></p>

      <p>Serving God isn’t just about doing good things. It’s about having the right heart behind what we do. Anyone can help others, but when we serve out of love for God, it changes everything. It’s not about getting attention or feeling important. It’s about honoring Him through our actions and showing His love wherever we go.</p>

      <p>There are times when you will serve and you could start to feel tired or unnoticed. Maybe you’re helping someone and they don’t say thank you, or you give your time, and no one seems to care. It’s easy to wonder if it really matters. But God sees what people don’t. He notices the quiet moments, the sacrifices, and the effort that others might overlook. He values a heart that serves for Him and not for recognition.</p>

      <p>Serving with a pure heart also means keeping a good attitude. Sometimes we’re called to help when it’s not convenient or when people are hard to love. That’s where God grows us. When we serve even when it’s tough, He blesses us in that. When our hearts stay focused on Him, our service becomes more than something we have to do— it becomes worship.</p>

      <p><strong>Here are some questions to think about:</strong><br>
      What’s one way you can check your heart before serving others?<br>
      How can you keep your focus on God when your efforts go unnoticed?</p>

      <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> Find one person you can serve this week with no expectation of anything in return. Do it quietly, from the heart, and take a moment afterward to thank God for letting you be His hands and feet.</p>
