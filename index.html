    <h2 id="mystory">My Story</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emoni. I grew up in the small town of Wadena, raised by my single mother. From an early age, I was deeply involved in the church, and my faith has been central to my life. I accepted Christ in 2014 and was baptized in 2016 at Wadena Assembly of God, a small but vibrant community where my mother serves as the youth pastor, worship leader, and also takes care of maintaining the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the church and volunteering alongside my mother shaped my values and work ethic. It stirred in me a passion not only for business but for making God the center of everything I do. These experiences continue to inspire me to pursue my goals with purpose, faith, and integrity.
    </p>

    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>

      I graduated from Wadena Deer Creek High School in Wadena, MN, in May 2023. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School, where I began my studies in August 2023 and plan to graduate in May 2027.

    <!-- ETHICS CHECKS -->
    <h2 id="ethics1">Ethics Check #1</h2>
    <p>Being made in the Image of God means that I have been created with the ability to love, create, and reason...</p>

    <h2 id="ethics2">Ethics Check #2</h2>
    <p>This term, one of the main things I’ll be working on is creating a website...</p>

    <h2 id="ethics3">Ethics Check #3</h2>
    <p>In business, I often work with private information. For example, when I handle financial records...</p>

    <h2 id="ethics4">Ethics Check #4</h2>
    <p>
      For my site, I plan to respect ownership by only using content I created or content I have permission to use. 
      If I use someone else’s work, I’ll credit them clearly and follow the licensing rules they set. A Creative Commons 
      license I’d use is CC BY because it lets others use my work as long as they give proper credit, which keeps it open 
      but respectful. The Bible tells us in Romans 13:7a to “Give to everyone what you owe them,” and that includes 
      honoring people for their ideas and creativity.
    </p>

    <h2 id="devotional">Serving with a Pure Heart</h2>
    <p>“Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people.” — Ephesians 6:7 (NIV)</p>
