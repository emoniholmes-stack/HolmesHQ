    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emoni. I grew up in the small town of Wadena, raised by my single mother. From an early age, I was deeply involved in the church, and my faith has been central to my life. I accepted Christ in 2014 and was baptized in 2016 at Wadena Assembly of God, a small but vibrant community where my mother serves as the youth pastor, worship leader, and also takes care of maintaining the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the church and volunteering alongside my mother shaped my values and work ethic. It stirred in me a passion not only for business but for making God the center of everything I do. These experiences continue to inspire me to pursue my goals with purpose, faith, and integrity.

    <!-- Ethics Check #1 -->
    <h2 id="ethics1">Ethics Check #1</h2>
    <p>
      Being made in the Image of God means that I have been created with the ability to love and create and reason. That understanding shapes the way I view AI as a tool. AI is something that humans created, and it can do a lot of things like: generate, analyze, and sound humanlike, but it doesn't have the unique creative thoughts that the Lord allows our minds to create. Because of that we should see AI as a resource not a replacement. It can help us, again, generate, analyze, organize, and brainstorm ideas, but should not and cannot replace our own critical thinking skills. Knowing that we reflect the Image of God should remind us that we should have good discernment when using AI, or just technology in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      One boundary that I keep when using AI is that I will never let it write or create something that is meant to represent my own voice. For example, I can use AI to create an outline for business papers, but should never replace the thoughts and critical thinking put into this. This makes sure that what I produce stays authentic to my voice and values. AI should be a support system, not a substitute. God gave us the ability to create and think and we should never undermine that or take advantage of it because of new technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that helps me use AI with humility is taking time to reflect and pray before and after using it. When using AI, we should remind ourselves that we are responsible for what we produce, but ultimately having the wisdom to use it well comes from God. After using AI, we should review what it suggested and make sure we aren't copying directly from what it generated. We should again use discernment, and apply our principles and values. This will help keep me aware that AI is a tool that we steward because the Lord allows us to use it.

    <h2 id="ethics2">Ethics Check #2</h2>
    <p>
      This term, one of the main things I’ll be working on is creating a website. I plan to use AI to help me with ideas, coding support, and design suggestions. AI can be really useful when I need quick answers or creative input, but it’s not always accurate. Sometimes it gives me code that doesn’t actually work when I test it, or it suggests designs that look good in theory but don’t fit my layout. There are also times when AI will confidently explain something that’s just plain wrong, especially when it comes to newer coding updates. Because of that, I can’t just take everything it says at face value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I use AI for building my website, I make sure to verify everything. If AI gives me a piece of code, I’ll test it myself and see if it runs correctly. If it doesn’t, I'll go back and ask it what factor I added that breaks the website and ask it to fix it. When it comes to content, like writing a short bio or explaining what my site is about, I’ll check that the information is true and that it actually represents me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A biblical principle that connects with this idea of being truthful is Proverbs 12:22, which says, “The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.” This verse reminds me that honesty isn’t just about what we say, it’s about how we work. If I’m building something like a website, I want it to reflect truth, not just creativity or skill. Using AI responsibly means being careful with what I post and making sure it’s accurate and authentic. In the end, the goal isn’t just to make something that looks good, it’s to build something that’s honest, reliable, and honors God in the process.
