    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emoni. I grew up in the small town of Wadena, raised by my single mother. From an early age, I was deeply involved in the church, and my faith has been central to my life. I accepted Christ in 2014 and was baptized in 2016 at Wadena Assembly of God, a small but vibrant community where my mother serves as the youth pastor, worship leader, and also takes care of maintaining the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the church and volunteering alongside my mother shaped my values and work ethic. It stirred in me a passion not only for business but for making God the center of everything I do. These experiences continue to inspire me to pursue my goals with purpose, faith, and integrity.

      I graduated from Wadena Deer Creek High School in Wadena, MN, in May 2023. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School, where I began my studies in August 2023 and plan to graduate in May 2027. My studies focus on combining practical business skills with a faith-driven approach, preparing me to lead with integrity and purpose in the professional world.
