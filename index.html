    <!-- My Story Section -->
    <h2 id="mystory">My Story</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emoni. I grew up in the small town of Wadena, raised by my single mother.
      From an early age, I was deeply involved in the church, and my faith has been central to my life.
      I accepted Christ in 2014 and was baptized in 2016 at Wadena Assembly of God, a small but vibrant community
      where my mother serves as the youth pastor, worship leader, and also takes care of maintaining the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the church and volunteering alongside my mother shaped my values and work ethic.
      It stirred in me a passion not only for business but for making God the center of everything I do.
      These experiences continue to inspire me to pursue my goals with purpose, faith, and integrity.
    </p>

    <!-- Education Section -->
    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>

      I graduated from Wadena Deer Creek High School in Wadena, MN, in May 2023. I am currently pursuing a
      Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School, where I began my studies
      in August 2023 and plan to graduate in May 2027. My studies focus on combining practical business skills with a

      I previously served as a Student Accounts Assistant at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School from August 2023 to May 2025,
      helping to create, organize, and send out billing statements. Earlier, I worked as a cashier at SuperOne Foods from
      November 2021 to August 2023, ensuring smooth and efficient shopping experiences for customers. These roles have
      strengthened my communication, organization, and problem-solving skills.

    <!-- Fun Facts Section -->
    <h2 id="funfacts">Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>
      I love playing volleyball and staying active through the sport. I am also in charge of Create, a group where we engage in creative
      activities like painting, drawing, and enjoying fellowship with one another. These are all things I genuinely enjoy and love to share with others.
    </p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #1 -->
    <h2 id="ethics1">Ethics Check #1</h2>
    <p>
      Being made in the Image of God means that I have been created with the ability to love and create and reason.
      That understanding shapes the way I view AI as a tool. AI is something that humans created, and it can do a lot of things like:
      generate, analyze, and sound humanlike, but it doesn't have the unique creative thoughts that the Lord allows our minds to create.
      Because of that we should see AI as a resource not a replacement. It can help us generate, analyze, organize, and brainstorm ideas,
      but should not and cannot replace our own critical thinking skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      One boundary that I keep when using AI is that I will never let it write or create something that is meant to represent my own voice.
      For example, I can use AI to create an outline for business papers, but should never replace the thoughts and critical thinking put into this.
      This makes sure that what I produce stays authentic to my voice and values. AI should be a support system, not a substitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that helps me use AI with humility is taking time to reflect and pray before and after using it. When using AI,
      we should remind ourselves that we are responsible for what we produce, but ultimately having the wisdom to use it well comes from God.
      After using AI, we should review what it suggested and make sure we aren't copying directly from what it generated.
    </p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #2 -->
    <h2 id="ethics2">Ethics Check #2</h2>
    <p>
      This term, one of the main things I’ll be working on is creating a website. I plan to use AI to help me with ideas, coding support,
      and design suggestions. AI can be really useful when I need quick answers or creative input, but it’s not always accurate.
      Sometimes it gives me code that doesn’t actually work when I test it, or it suggests designs that look good in theory but don’t fit my layout.
      Because of that, I can’t just take everything it says at face value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I use AI for building my website, I make sure to verify everything. If AI gives me a piece of code, I’ll test it myself and see if it runs correctly.
      If it doesn’t, I'll go back and ask it what factor I added that breaks the website and ask it to fix it. When it comes to content, like writing a short bio
      or explaining what my site is about, I’ll check that the information is true and that it actually represents me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A biblical principle that connects with this idea of being truthful is Proverbs 12:22, which says, “The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.” 
      This verse reminds me that honesty isn’t just about what we say, it’s about how we work. If I’m building something like a website, I want it to reflect truth, not just creativity or skill.
    </p>

    <!-- Devotional Section -->
    <h2 id="devotional">Serving with a Pure Heart</h2>
    <p><strong>Serving with a Pure Heart</strong></p>
    <p>“Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people.” — Ephesians 6:7 (NIV)</p>
    <p>
      Serving God isn’t just about doing good things. It’s about having the right heart behind what we do. Anyone can help others,
      but when we serve out of love for God, it changes everything. It’s not about getting attention or feeling important.
      It’s about honoring Him through our actions and showing His love wherever we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times when you will serve and you could start to feel tired or unnoticed. Maybe you’re helping someone and they don’t say thank you,
      or you give your time, and no one seems to care. It’s easy to wonder if it really matters. But God sees what people don’t.
      He notices the quiet moments, the sacrifices, and the effort that others might overlook. He values a heart that serves for Him and not for recognition.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Questions</strong></p>
    <p>— What’s one way you can check your heart before serving others?</p>
    <p>— How can you keep your focus on God when your efforts go unnoticed?</p>
    <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> Find one person you can serve this week with no expectation of anything in return. Do it quietly, from the heart, and take a moment afterward to thank God for letting you be His hands and feet.</p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #3 -->
    <h2 id="ethics3">Ethics Check #3</h2>
    <p>
      In business, I often work with private information. For example, when I handle financial records, customer accounts, or billing statements,
      I might see names, payment details, or other sensitive info. It’s important to handle that carefully so people can trust me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will never share personal or financial details like social security numbers, bank account info, or anything confidential. If I ever need to use an example or show something for work or learning, I will get permission first. I will make sure the person knows what I need, why I need it, and how it will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scripture that guides me is <strong>Philippians 2:4</strong>, which says, “Let each of you look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.” Respecting someone’s private information is one way to do that in business. It shows care for them, protects them, and keeps my work honest.
    </p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #4 -->
    <h2 id="ethics4">Ethics Check #4</h2>
    <p>
      For my site, I plan to respect ownership by only using content I created or content I have permission to use. If I use someone else’s work,
      I’ll credit them clearly and follow the licensing rules they set. A Creative Commons license I’d use is CC BY because it lets others use my work as long as they give proper credit, which keeps it open but respectful. The Bible tells us in Romans 13:7a to “Give to everyone what you owe them,” and that includes honoring people for their ideas and creativity.
    </p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #5 -->
    <h2 id="ethics5">Ethics Check #5</h2>
    <p>
      I wrote the About Me section, although I asked ChatGPT to help refine it to sound more professional. The Skills and Strengths section came directly from my resume, but ChatGPT formatted it for clarity. The Ethics Checks were influenced by AI: I had the ideas and asked ChatGPT to include them within the assignments, and the Devotional was mostly AI-generated. All the Resources came from ChatGPT. For the FAQ section, the questions came from ChatGPT, but the answers were my own, and the Worship Night content was entirely generated by ChatGPT; I simply provided my ideas, and it formatted them. I plan to keep this in my voice by continuing to give ChatGPT my ideas and asking it to help format and organize them, while ensuring it doesn’t change anything I wouldn’t say or think.
    </p>

    <!-- Ethics Check #6 -->
    <h2 id="ethics6">Ethics Check #6</h2>
    <p>
      In business, AI can be biased in hiring, like preferring candidates from certain schools, backgrounds, or even writing styles. This can make it harder for some people to get a fair chance. To prevent that, I’d always double-check AI recommendations with my own judgment and make sure I’m looking at the whole person, not just what the algorithm favors. This connects to Proverbs 24:23, which says showing favoritism in judging isn’t good. Treating everyone fairly isn’t just smart business, it’s the right thing to do.
    </p>

    <h2 id="verseoftheweek">Verse of the Week</h2>
    <p><strong>Philippians 4:7 (ESV)</strong> “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”</p>
    <p>
      God’s peace isn’t something you have to earn, it’s something He gives. When your mind feels busy or your heart feels heavy, pause and hand it back to Him. He’s guarding you, covering you, and keeping you steady even when life feels loud. Let His peace be the thing that leads your week.
