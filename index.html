    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emoni. I grew up in the small town of Wadena, raised by my single mother. From an early age, I was deeply involved in the church, and my faith has been central to my life. I accepted Christ in 2014 and was baptized in 2016 at Wadena Assembly of God, a small but vibrant community where my mother serves as the youth pastor, worship leader, and also takes care of maintaining the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the church and volunteering alongside my mother shaped my values and work ethic. It stirred in me a passion not only for business but for making God the center of everything I do. These experiences continue to inspire me to pursue my goals with purpose, faith, and integrity.

      I have gained diverse experience in customer service and administrative roles.

I previously served as a Student Accounts Assistant at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School from August 2023 to May 2025, helping to create, organize, and send out billing statements. Earlier, I worked as a cashier at SuperOne Foods from November 2021 to August 2023, ensuring smooth and efficient shopping experiences for customers.
